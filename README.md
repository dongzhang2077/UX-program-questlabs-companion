## 🎯 What is QuestLabs Companion?

[cite_start]QuestLabs Companion is a mobile application designed specifically for **college students in cohort-based personal development programs**[cite: 2, 27]. It helps students bridge the gap between daily actions and long-term aspirations through a privacy-first, community-driven approach.

[cite_start]Unlike generic habit trackers, we integrate three critical dimensions of student life[cite: 27]:
* 🧠 **Emotional Wellness** - Track mood trends and emotional patterns.
* 🤝 **Relational Quality** - Monitor connection quality with friends and family.
* 🎓 **Academic Progress** - Connect daily study tasks to career visions.

## ✨ Core Features (MVP)

[cite_start]Based on our P0/P1 prioritization [cite: 347-380]:

### [cite_start]1️⃣ Three-Layer Goal Framework [cite: 353]
A structured hierarchy to ensure every action has a purpose:
* **Vision Goals (2-3 Years):** Long-term aspirations.
* **Quarterly Goals:** 90-day milestones breaking down the vision.
* **Weekly Quests:** Concrete tasks for the current week.

### [cite_start]2️⃣ Daily Check-In (<2 Minutes) [cite: 348]
[cite_start]Validated by 79% of users who demanded speed[cite: 352].
* **3 Sliders:** Quickly rate Emotional, Relational, and Academic status.
* **Quest Selection:** Check off today's tasks.
* **Optional Note:** Add a brief reflection if needed.

### [cite_start]3️⃣ Quest Board (BINGO Style) [cite: 371]
* Replaces infinite to-do lists with a **5-cell weekly grid**.
* Focuses on visual progress without high-pressure gamification.

### [cite_start]4️⃣ Visual Progress Dashboard [cite: 357]
* **Trend Graphs:** Visualize mood and academic trends over 7/30 days.
* [cite_start]**Wheel of Life:** See balance across 8 life domains[cite: 360].
* [cite_start]**Weekly Insights:** AI-powered pattern detection[cite: 466].

### [cite_start]5️⃣ Privacy-First Cohort Space [cite: 362]
* **Aggregated Data:** See how the team is doing (e.g., "Team Average: 78%") without exposing individual privacy.
* [cite_start]**Encouragement:** Send emoji reactions (💪❤️🔥) to support peers[cite: 374].

## 📊 Research & Validation

Our design is strictly data-driven, based on two rounds of user studies.

### User Study 1: Requirements Gathering (n=14)
* [cite_start]**79%** of students demand check-ins under 2 minutes[cite: 235].
* [cite_start]**71%** prefer visual charts over text journaling[cite: 236].
* [cite_start]**64%** value peer support, but **71%** require strict privacy control[cite: 245].
* [cite_start]**Key Insight:** "Forgetting" is the #1 barrier (64%), making reminders essential[cite: 241].

### User Study 2: Prototype Evaluation (n=5)
* [cite_start]**SUS Score:** **78.0** (Grade B, Top 25% of products)[cite: 657].
* [cite_start]**Task Completion:** 100% success rate on core workflows[cite: 684].
* [cite_start]**Validation:** 100% of users felt comfortable with the privacy-preserving cohort features[cite: 796].

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### "Anti-Gamification" Approach
[cite_start]We intentionally removed anxiety-inducing mechanics based on our research[cite: 473]:
* 🚫 **No Public Leaderboards:** Avoids unhealthy comparison.
* 🚫 **No "Streak Lost" Punishments:** Prevents guilt; emphasizes consistency over perfection.
* ✅ **Focus on Meaning:** Prioritizes internal motivation and qualitative reflection.

### Personas
[cite_start]We designed for 4 specific student archetypes[cite: 251]:
1.  **Sarah:** The busy graduate student needing quick <2 min check-ins.
2.  **Michael:** The team player seeking connection without competition.
3.  **Emily:** The career-changer wanting visual skill progress.
4.  **David:** The experienced student wanting a professional tool.
