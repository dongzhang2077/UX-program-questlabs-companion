## SUS Score Calculation (For Analysis)

### Formula:

1. For odd-numbered questions (7, 9, 11, 13, 15): Score = (Response - 1)
2. For even-numbered questions (8, 10, 12, 14, 16): Score = (5 - Response)
3. Sum all scores
4. Multiply by 2.5
5. **Final SUS Score** = Sum × 2.5 (out of 100)

### Interpretation:

- **80-100**: Excellent (A)
- **70-79**: Good (B)
- **60-69**: Fair (C)
- **50-59**: Poor (D)
- **0-49**: Fail (F)

**Target**: ≥70 for acceptable usability
